<h1>Edward Liu Bio Page</h1>

<intro>
<p1>My name is Edward Liu. I was born on February 7th, 2003, in Galveston, Texas. I was raised by my mother and father, Fengwu Li and Jian Liu, alongside my sister Liyan Liu, who is 8 years my elder. I currently live in San Diego, California where I am a high school student attending Canyon Crest Academy in Carmel Valley as a Freshman. I have taken piano lessons since 7 years old and have taught myself to play the guitar. I am very intersested in physics, computers, and math, and I hope eventually I will be able to contribute to those fields of study. </p1>
